## Current Features

- **F1, Original and Video Extension Generations**: Run all in a single queue
- **End Frame Control for 'Original' Model**: Provides greater control over generations
- **Upscaling and Post-processing**
- **Timestamped Prompts**: Define different prompts for specific time segments in your video
- **Prompt Blending**: Define the blending time between timestamped prompts
- **LoRA Support**: Works with most (all?) Hunyuan Video LoRAs
- **Queue System**: Process multiple generation jobs without blocking the interface. Import and export queues.
- **Metadata Saving/Import**: Prompt and seed are encoded into the output PNG, all other generation metadata is saved in a JSON file that can be imported later for similar generations.
- **Custom Presets**: Allow quick switching between named groups of parameters. A custom Startup Preset can also be set.
- **I2V and T2V**: Works with or without an input image to allow for more flexibility when working with standard Hunyuan Video LoRAs
- **Latent Image Options**: When using T2V you can generate based on a black, white, green screen, or pure noise image

## Prerequisites

- CUDA-compatible GPU with at least 6GB VRAM (8GB+ recommended for optimal performance; 16GB+ for high-resolution/long videos)
- 16GB System Memory (32GB+ strongly recommended)
- 80GB+ of storage (including ~25GB for each model family: Original and F1)

## Contributing 

We would love your help building FramePack Studio! To make collaboration effective, please adhere to the following:
- Keep Pull Requests Focused: Each Pull Request should address a single issue or add one specific feature. Please do not mix bug fixes, new features, and code refactoring in the same PR.
- Target the develop Branch: All Pull Requests must be opened against the develop branch. PRs opened against the main branch will be closed.
- Discuss Big Changes First: If you plan to work on a large feature or a significant refactor, please announce it first in the #contributors channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/MtuM7gFJ3V). This helps us coordinate efforts and prevent duplicate work.
